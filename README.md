## 1. Objective

The primary objective of the AI Diabetics Prediction System is to develop a predictive model that can assess an individual's risk of developing diabetes based on their health data. This model will be trained on a diverse dataset of patient information, and it will utilize advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to make predictions.

Phase 1 of the project focuses on setting up the foundational components of the system, including data collection, storage, and preprocessing. This phase does not include the development of the predictive model itself, but it lays the groundwork for future phases.

## 2. Features

Phase 1 of the AI Diabetics Prediction System includes the following key features:

- **Data Collection**: Collecting diverse health-related data from various sources, including medical records, wearables, and surveys.

- **Data Storage**: Designing and implementing a data storage system to securely store and manage the collected health data.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Developing data preprocessing pipelines to clean, normalize, and prepare the data for model training.

- **Data Privacy and Security**: Ensuring that sensitive health data is handled with strict privacy and security measures to comply with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

## 3. System Architecture

Phase 1 of the system architecture is primarily focused on data collection and storage. It includes the following components:

- **Data Collection Services**: These services are responsible for retrieving and aggregating health-related data from various sources, such as hospitals, clinics, and wearable devices.

- **Data Storage**: The collected data is securely stored in a database or data lake, with a strong emphasis on privacy and security.

- **Data Preprocessing Pipeline**: Data preprocessing pipelines are used to clean, transform, and structure the data, making it suitable for use in later phases for model development.

- **User Access Management**: A system for controlling and monitoring access to the data, ensuring only authorized individuals can work with it.

## 4. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting with Phase 1 of the AI Diabetics Prediction System, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Python (recommended version 3.7 or higher)
- Database system for data storage (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Necessary libraries and packages (requirements will be provided in the code repository)

### Installation

Detailed installation instructions will be provided in the code repository for Phase 1.

### Usage

Once the system components are set up, you will be able to collect and store health data. The subsequent phases will focus on developing the prediction model.

## 5. Data Sources

The project relies on a variety of data sources, including but not limited to:

- Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
- Health surveys and questionnaires
- Wearable devices and fitness trackers
- Blood tests and laboratory results

Data sources are selected to ensure the model's predictions are accurate and comprehensive.
